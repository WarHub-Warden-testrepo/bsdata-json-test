When charging a unit of the opposite side of a defence line, the charge is successful if the charging unit can move within 2\" of that unit. When resolving fights between units on two opposite sides of a defence line, unit can be chosen to fight and make their attacks if the enemy is within 2\" instead of the normal 1\"."
