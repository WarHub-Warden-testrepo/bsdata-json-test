Note, however, that the Skyshield Landing Pad itself does not receive an invulnerable save in this manner.  - Unfurled: Any friendly unit with the Flyer Battlefield Role that spends its entire turn on top of a Skyshield Landing Pad in this configuration regains D3 lost wounds at the end of the turn as a result of the landing pad's auto-repair systems."
