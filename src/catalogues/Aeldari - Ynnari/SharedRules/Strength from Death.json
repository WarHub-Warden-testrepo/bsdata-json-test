        "This ability is common to all YNNARI INFANTRY and YNNARI BIKER units and the Yncarne.  Each time a unit is completely destroyed within 7\" of one or more units with this ability, except in the Morale phase, pick one of those units to make a Soulburst action. That unit can immediately do one of the following, even if it has already done so in this turn (if the unit was destroyed as the result of a unit’s action – e.g. making a shooting attack or fighting – the Soulburst action is resolved after the unit has completely resolved its current action, e.g. after it has completed all of its shooting attacks or after it has finished fighting, including making any consolidation moves):",

        "-The unit can move as if it were your Movement phase.  It can Advance or Fall Back as part of this move.",
        "-The unit can, if it is a PSYKER, immediately attempt to manifest a single psychic power as if it were the Psychic phase.",
        "-The unit can shoot as if it were your Shooting phase, even if it Advanced or Fell Back this turn.",
        "-The unit can charge as if it were the Charge phase, even if it Advanced or Fell Back this turn(enemy units can fire Overwatch as normal).  A unit cannot do this if is within 1\" of an enemy unit.",
