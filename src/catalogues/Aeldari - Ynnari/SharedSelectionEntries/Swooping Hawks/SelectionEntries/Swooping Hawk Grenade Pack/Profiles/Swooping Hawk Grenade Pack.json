To do so after the unit has been set up using the Children of Baharroth ability, pick an enemy unit within 12\" of them. To do so after the unit has moved, pick one enemy unit that they flew over. Then, in either case, roll one dice for each model in the enemy unit (up to a maximum of one dice for each model in the Swooping Hawks unit). For each time roll of a 6 the enemy unit suffers a mortal wound."
