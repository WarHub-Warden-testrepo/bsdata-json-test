          "value": "A Skathach Wraithknight can Fall Back in the Movement phase and still shoot and/or charge during its turn. When a Skathach Wraithknight Falls Back, it can even move over enemy INFANTRY models, though at the end of its move it must be more than 1\" from all enemy units. In addition, a Skathach Wraithknight can move and fire Heavy weapons without suffering the penalty to its hit rolls. Finally, a Skathach Wraithknight only gains a bonus to its save in cover if at least half of the model is obsured from the firer."
