In addition, once per battle, in your Shooting phase, a Wave Serpent can discharge its serpent shield in its Shooting phase by rolling a D6. On a 2+ the nearest visible enemy unit within 24\" suffers D3 mortal wounds. The Wave Serpent then gains no benefit from this ability for the remainder of the battle."
