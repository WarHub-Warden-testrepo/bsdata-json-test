When they do so, any restrictions or modifiers that apply to this model also apply to its passengers; for example, the pasengers cannot shoot if this model has Fallen Back in the same turn and so on, cannot shoot (except with Pistols) if this model is within 1\" of an enemy unit, and so on. Note that the passengers cannot shoot if this model Falls Back, even though the vehicle itself can."
