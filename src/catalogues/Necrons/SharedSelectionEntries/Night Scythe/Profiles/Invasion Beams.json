Before the Night Scythe moves in each of your Movement phases, a single unit that was set up on their tomb world can be beamed onto the battlefield by the Night Scythe.  To do so, set up the unit so that it is wholly within 3\" of the Night Scythe and more than 1\" from the enemy.  If all friendly Night Scythes and Monoliths are destroyed, any units still on the tomb world are considered to be slain."
