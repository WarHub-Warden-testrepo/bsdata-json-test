On a roll of 1, one of those Canoptek Spyders units suffers D3 mortal wounds.  On a 2+ one of the Canoptek Spyders units unleashes reinforcements: return a Canoptek Scarab Swarm to the depleted unit, in unit coherency and more than 1\" from enemy models.  If you cannot do this because there is no room to place the model, do not set it up."
