Before the Monolith moves in each of your Movement phases, a single unit that was set up on their tomb world can be beamed onto the battlefield by the Monolith.  To do so, set up the unit so that it is wholly within 3\" of friendly Tomb Ziggurats, NIGHT SCYTHES and MONOLITHS. If all friendly NIGHT SCYTHES, MONOLITHS and/or Tomb Ziggurats are destroyed, any units still on the tomb world are considered to be slain."
