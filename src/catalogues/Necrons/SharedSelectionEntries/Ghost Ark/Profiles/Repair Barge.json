Any models returned to the unit this way are added to the number of models embarked on the Ghost Ark - if any models cannot be returned because there is no more room on the Ghost Ark, they are not returned this turn.  In addition, at the end of each of your Movement phases, you can make Reanimation Protocol rolls for any slain models from a single DYNASTY Warriors unit within 3\" of the Ghost Ark.  You cannot use this ability on a unit that has been targeted with a resurrection orb this turn."
