Instead, friendly IMPERIUM INFANTRY and BIKER units within 6\" of the bearer in the Morale phase automatically pass Morale tests, and once per battle in your Movement phase, if the bearer does not move, you can roll a D6 for each unit (friend or foe) within 6\". Subtract 1 from the result if the unit being rolled for is a CHARACTER, or 2 from the result if the unit being rolled for is ADEPTUS CUSTODES. On a 4+ the unit being rolled for suffers D3 mortal wounds."
