At the end of your opponent's Charge phase, if there is an enemy model within 1\" of that character, you can remove the bearer from the battlefield (if they are on the battlefield) and, even if they were not on the battlefield, set them up within 3\" of that character and within 1\" of an enemy model. The bearer is not considered to have charged."
