In addition, if the Blue Scribes syphoned any psychic powers in the last enemy Psychic phase they will also automatically manifest the Smite psychic power. No Psychic test is taken to use any of these powers, and they cannot be denied. Where the result of the Psychic test matters, the psychic power is treated as having been manifested with the minimum roll possible and without rolling a double."
