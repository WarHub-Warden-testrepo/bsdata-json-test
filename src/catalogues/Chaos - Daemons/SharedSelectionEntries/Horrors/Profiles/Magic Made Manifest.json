          "value": "A unit of Horrors can attempt to manifest one psychic power in each friendly Psychic phase, and attempt to deny one psychic power in each enemy Psychic phase. However, when you do so, only roll a single D6 for the Psychic test or Deny the Witch test, and use the result of the single dice roll to determine the outcome. Note that this means that Horrors can't roll a double 1 or double 6 to suffer Perils of the Warp. In addition, if the unit manifests the Smite power whilst it contains less than 10 Pink Horrors, it only inflicts 1 mortal wound rather than D3."
