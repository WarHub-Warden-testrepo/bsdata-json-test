Each time a Blue Horror is slain, you can add one pair of Brimstone Horrors to this unit before you remove the slain model. The replacement models cannot be placed within 1\" of an enemy model. Note that Horrors that flee do not generate any extra models for their unit.  Matched Play: In matched play you must pay reinforcement points for each and every Blue and Brimstone Horror model that you add to a unit of Horrors, but the additional models can take the unit above its starting strength."
