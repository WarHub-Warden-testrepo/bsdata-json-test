After the Hell Talon has moved, pick an enemy unit that it flew over, then roll 3D6 for each VEHICLE or MONSTER in the unit or a single D6 for every other model in the unit, up to a maximum of 9D6. For every roll of a 5+, the unit suffers a mortal wound. In addition, the targeted unit subtracts 1 from its hit rolls and Leadership characteristic until the start of your opponent's next game turn."
