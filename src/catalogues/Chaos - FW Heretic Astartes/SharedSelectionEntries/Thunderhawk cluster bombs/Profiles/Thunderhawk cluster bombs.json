After the Chaos Thunderhawk Gunship has moved, pick a single enemy unit that it flew over. Roll 3D6 for every Vehicle or Monster, or a D6 for every other model in the unit, up to a maximum of 132D6 per unit. For each roll of a 5+, the unit suffers a mortal wound. A Unit which consists only of Characters cannot be targeted by this ability."
