A single Chaos Space Marine Crewman cannot operate multiple Hellforged Rapiers in this way in a single turn. If all of the Chaos Space Marine Crewman from the same unit within 6\" of a Hellforged Rapier are slain, it loses the Artillery ability and gains the Daemon Unleashed ability and operates under the rules of that ability instead."
