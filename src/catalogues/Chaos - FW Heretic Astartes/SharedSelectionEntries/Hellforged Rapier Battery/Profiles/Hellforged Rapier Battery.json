While a Hellforged Rapier has this ability, it must move as far as possible directly towards the nearest visible enemy during the Movement phase (it does not have to Advance, but may do so if the controlling player wishes), it may fire normally in the Shooting phase, even if no friendly Chaos Space Marine Crewman are within 6\" and must declare a Charge in the Charge phase if there are any enemy units within 12\" at the beginning of that phase."
