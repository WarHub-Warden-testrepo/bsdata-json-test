While the helical targeting array is active, the Hellforged Deredeo Dreadnought may not move, Advance, or charge in any phase, but adds 1 to its hit rolls for targeting vehicles with the FLY keyword. The helical targeting array remains active from the start of the turn in which their use is declared until the beginning of the controlling player's next turn. The helical targeting array may be activated any number of times during a game, but not in consecutive turns."
