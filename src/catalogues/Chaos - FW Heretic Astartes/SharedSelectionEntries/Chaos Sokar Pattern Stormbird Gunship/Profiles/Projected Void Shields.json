In game terms, void shields are represented by a unique kind of saving throw which the controlling player can opt to use instead of their normal save or invulnerable save against any form of attack except from weapons with the Melee type. like invulnerable saves, void shield saves are unaffected by the AP of an attack, but unlike invulnerable saves they may also be used to negate mortal wounds. In this case, roll one dice for each mortal wound that has been inflicted on the Chaos Sokar Pattern Stormbird, with the mortal wound being ignored if the save roll is passed."
