          "value": "When targeting this unit with shooting attacks and psychic powers, always measure to the model's hull where it would be at a tabletop level, even if it is on a flying base. In addition, unless the attacking unit can Fly, add 12\" to the measured distance to determine the range when making shooting attacks against it. Note that this means many short-ranged shooting weapons will not be able to hit this model. Your opponent must also subtract 1 from hit rolls for attacks that target this model in the Shooting phase."
