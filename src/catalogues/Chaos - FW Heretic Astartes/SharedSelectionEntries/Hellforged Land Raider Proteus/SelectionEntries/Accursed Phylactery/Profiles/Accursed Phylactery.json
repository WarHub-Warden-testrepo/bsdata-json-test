          "value": "The fallen and tormented souls bound to the phylactery constantly swirl about the Hellforged Proteus in battle. All units within 9\" (both friendly and enemy) must subtract 1 from their Leadership, and if any enemy units attempt to enter the game from a position that is not represented on the tabletop (i.e., in orbit, teleport, from the hidden halls of the Webway, etc) anywhere within 12\" of the Hellforged Land Raider Proteus, the arriving unit's controlling player must roll a D6. If the score is a 1 or a 2 then the unit suffers D3 mortal wounds as it is deployed on the battlefield."
