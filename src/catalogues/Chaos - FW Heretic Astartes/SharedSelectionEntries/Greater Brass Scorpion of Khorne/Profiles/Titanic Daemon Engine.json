In this case, it can shoot the enemy unit that is within 1\" of it or any other visible enemy unit that is within range and more than 1\" away from any friendly models. In addition, the Greater Brass Scorpion of Khorne can move and fire Heavy weapons wihtout suffering the penalty to its hit rolls. Finally, the Greater Brass Scorpion of Khorne only gains a bonus to its save in cover if at least half of the model is obscured from the bearer."
