If you do so, it can make a Drop Pod Assault at the end of any of your Movement phases. When it does so, set it up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9\" from any enemy models. Any models embarked inside must immediately disembark, but they cannot be set up within 9\" of any enemy models. Any models that cannot be set up because there is not enough room are slain."
