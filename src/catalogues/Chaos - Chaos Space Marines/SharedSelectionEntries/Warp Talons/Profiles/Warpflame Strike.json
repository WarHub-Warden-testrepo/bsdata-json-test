If it is, it can use a Warpflame Strike to arrive on the battlefield at the end of any of your Movement phases, when it does so, set the unit up anywhere that is more than 9\" away from enemy models. In addition, enemy units cannot fire Overwatch against units in the same turn that they arrived by warpflame strike."
