For that fight, the first roll is added to the Mutilator's Strength for the unit's attacks, the second roll is the AP for the unit's attacks, and the third roll is the Damage for the unit's attacks. For example, if the rolls were a 1, followed by a 3, followed by a 2, then all of the unit's attacks for that fight would have Strength of +1, an AP of -3, and a Damage of 2."
