In this case it can shoot the enemy unit that is within 1\" of it, or any other visible enemy unit that is within range and more than 1\" away from any friendly models. In addition, a Khorne Lord of Skulls can move and fire Heavy weapons without suffering the penalty to its hit rolls. Finally, a Khorne Lord of Skulls only gains a bonus to its save in cover if at least half of the model is obscured from the firer."
