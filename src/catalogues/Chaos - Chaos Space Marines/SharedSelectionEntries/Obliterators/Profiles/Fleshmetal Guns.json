The first roll is added to 6 to determine the Strength for the unit's shooting attacks, the second rol is the AP, and the third roll is the Damage. For example, if the rolls were a 1 followed by a 3, followed by a 2, then the unit's attacks would haev a Strength of 7, an AP of -3 and a Damage of 2 for that Shooting phase and Overwatch phase."
