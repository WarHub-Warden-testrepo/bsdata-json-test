It can even move over enemy INFANTRY UNITS, thought at the end of its turn it must be more than 1\" from all enemy units. In addition, a Renegage Knight can move and fire Heavy weapons without suffering the penalty to its hit rolls. Finally, a Renegade Knight only gains a bonus to its save in cover if at least half the model is obscured from the firer."
