You can attempt to change the unit's battle protocol at the start of each of your Movement phases if there is a friendly <FORGE WORLD> Cybernetica Datasmith within 6\".  To do so, roll a D6; on a 2+ the attempt is successful and you can select any one of the three battle protocols that take effect from the start of the next battle round. Otherwise, the attempt fails and the unit's current protocol remains in effect Aegis Protocol: Whilst this battle protocol is in effect, you can add 1 to any armour and invulnerable saving throws you make for models in the unit.  Conqueror Protocol: Whilst this battle protocol is in effect, this unit cannot shoot, but it can fight twice in each Fight phase instead of only once.  Protector Protocol: Whilst this battle protocol is in effect, this unit cannot move or charge, but it can shoot twice in each of your Shooting phases (and shoot twice when firing Overwatch)"
