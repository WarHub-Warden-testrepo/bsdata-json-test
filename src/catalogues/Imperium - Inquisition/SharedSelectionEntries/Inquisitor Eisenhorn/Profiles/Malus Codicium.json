If he does so, he loses his Unquestionable Wisdom ability for the remainder of the battle, but you can immediately set up a Daemonhost model (see Index: Imperium 2) anywhere on the battlefield that is within 6\" of Inquisitor Eisenhorn and more than 1\" away from enemy models. This Daemonhost has the CHARACTER keyword, and its strength, toughness, wounds and attacks characteristics are all increased by 2.  Furthermore, while this Daemonhost remains within 6\" of Inquisitor Eisenhorn, add 1 to hit rolls, wound rolls and invulnerable saving throws made for it. If inquisitor Eisenhorn is slain, this Daemonhost is removed as a casualty as well. If you are playing a matched play game, you must pay reinforcement points for this Daemonhost."
