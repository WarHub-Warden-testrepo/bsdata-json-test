Each player then rolls a D6 and adds their model's Leadership characteristic to their result. If your opponent scores higher, or if the scores are drawn, nothing happens. If your score is higher, the enemy model reduces its Leadership, Ballistic Skill and Weapon Skill characteristics by 1 for the rest of the battle."
