At the end of any of your movement phases this unit can perform a drop pod assault - set it up on the battlefield anywhere that is more than 9\" away from enemy models. Any models inside must immediately disembark, but they must be set up more than 9\" from any enemy models. Any model that cannot be set up because there is not enough room is slain."
