In addition, during deployment you can set up this unit if it is equipped with grapnel launchers behing enemy lines instead of placing it on the battlefield. At the the end of your movement phase this unit can join the battle. Set it up within 6\" of a battlefield edge of your choice and more than 9\" away from any enemy models."
