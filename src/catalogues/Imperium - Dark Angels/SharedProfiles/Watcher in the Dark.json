On a 3+ the power has no effect on this unit (all other targets are affected normally). Remove the Watcher in the Dark model from play after this roll has been made, whether successful or not. The Watcher in the Dark model must always remain as close to this unit as possible, but is otherwise ignored for all other gaming purposes. Remove the Watcher in the Dark if this unit is slain."
