Select a friendly DEATH KORPS OF KRIEG INFANTRY unit within 3\" and roll a D6. On a roll of 4+, one model in the unit recovers a wound it lost earlier in the battle (if the unit has a Wounds characteristic of 1, one model slain earlier in the battle is returned to the unit instead). A unit can only be the target of this ability once in each turn."
