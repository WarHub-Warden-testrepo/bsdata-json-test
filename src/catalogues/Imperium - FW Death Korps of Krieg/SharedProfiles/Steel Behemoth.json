This model can Fall Back in the Movement phase and still shoot and/or charge during its turn. It can also still fire its weapons if enemy units are withing 1\" of it (but only its twin heavy bolter or twin heavy flamer can taget units that are within 1\" of it -- its other guns must target other units). In addition this model only gains a bonus to its save in cover if at least half of the model is obscured from the firer."
