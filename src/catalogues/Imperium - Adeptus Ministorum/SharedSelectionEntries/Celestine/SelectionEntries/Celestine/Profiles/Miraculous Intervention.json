On a roll of 2+ she is not removed, but is instead resurrected with all her wounds restored; set you Celestine's model within 2\" of a Geminae Superia. If it is impossible to do so - because, for example, no Geminae Superia remain in play- you can instead place Celestine anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9\" away from any enemy models. On a roll of 1 Celestine is needed elsewhere, remove any remaining Geminae Superia, and count Celestine and her bodyguard as having been slain for the purposes of any mission rules or victory conditions."
