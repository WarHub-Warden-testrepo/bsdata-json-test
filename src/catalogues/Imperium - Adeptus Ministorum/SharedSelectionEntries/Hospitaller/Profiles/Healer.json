Select a friendly ADEPTA SORORITAS INFANTRY unit within 3\" of the Hospitaller and roll a D6. On a roll of 4+, one model in the unit recovers D3 lost wounds; if the chosen unit contains no wounded models but one or more of its models have been slain during the battle, then a single slain model is returned to the unit with 1 wound remaining. A unit can only be the target of the Healer ability one in each turn"
