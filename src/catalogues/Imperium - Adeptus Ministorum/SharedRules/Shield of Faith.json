In addition, units with the Shield of Faith ability can attempt to deny one psychic power in each enemy Psychic phase in the same manner as a PSYKER. However, if they do so, instead of rolling 2D6, only roll a single D6; the psychic power is resisted if the roll is greater than the result of the Psychic test that manifested the power.",
