In addition, during deployment, you can set up this unit, if it is equipped with grapnel launchers, behind enemy lines instead of placing it on the battlefield. At the end of any of your Movement phases this unit can join the battle - set it up within 6\" of a battlefield edge of your choice and more than 9\" away from any enemy models."
