When they do so, any restrictions or modifiers that apply to this model also apply to its passengers; for example, the passengers cannot shoot if this model has Fallen back in the same turn, cannot shoot (except with Pistols) if this model is within 1\" of an enemy unit, and so on. Note that the passengers cannot shoot if this model Falls Back, even though the Land Speeder Storm itself can."
