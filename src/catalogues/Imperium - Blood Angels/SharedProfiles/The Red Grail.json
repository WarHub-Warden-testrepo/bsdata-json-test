In addition, each time you make a hit roll of 6+ in the Fight phase for a model in a friendly BLOOD ANGELS unit that is within 6\" of Brother Corbulo, that model may immediately make another close combat attack using the same weapons. These bonus attacks cannot themselves generate any additional close combat attacks."
