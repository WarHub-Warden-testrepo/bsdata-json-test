When it does so, remove the Armorium Cherub and that model can immediately shoot again. The removal of an Armorium Cherub (for any reason) is ignored for the purposes of morale. The Armorium Cherub does not count as a model for the purposes of Combat Squads ability. If a Devastator Squad is split using the Combat Squads ability, the Armorium Cherub must accompany one of the units."
