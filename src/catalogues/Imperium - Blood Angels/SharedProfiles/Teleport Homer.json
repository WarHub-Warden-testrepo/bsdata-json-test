If an enemy model is ever within 9\" of the teleport homer, it is deactivated and removed from the battlefield. Whilst there are any friendly <CHAPTER> teleport homers on the battlefield, this unit can perform an emergency teleport instead of moving in its Movement phase. At the end of the Movement phase, remove this unit and then set it up with all models within 6\" of a friendly <CHAPTER> teleport homer. That teleport homer is then removed from the battlefield."
