You can summon one new NURGLE DAEMON unit with the Daemonic Ritual ability to the battlefield that has a Power Rating equal to or less than the total result. This unit is treated as reinforcements for your army and can be placed anywhere on the battlefield that is entirely within 12\" of the character and is more than 9\" from any enemy model. If the total rolled is insufficient to summon any unit, the ritual fails and no new unit is summoned.",
