Until the start of your next Psychic phase, you can re-roll charge rolls and Advance rolls for that unit and they always fight first in the Fight phase, even if they didn't charge. If the enemy unit also has units that have charged, or that have a similar ability, then alternate choosing units to fight with, starting with the player whose turn is taking place."
