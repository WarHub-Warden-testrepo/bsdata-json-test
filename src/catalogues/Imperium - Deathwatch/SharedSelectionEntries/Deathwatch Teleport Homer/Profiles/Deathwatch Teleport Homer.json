If an enemy model is ever within 9\" of the Deathwatch teleport homer, it is deactivated and removed from the battlefield.  Whilst there are any friendly Deathwatch teleport homers on the battlefield, a unit that contains one or more Deathwatch Terminators can perform an emergency teleport instead of moving in its Movement phase.  At the end fo the Movement phase, remove the unit and then set it up with all models within 6\" of a friendly Deathwatch teleport homer.  That Deathwatch teleport homer then shorts out and is removed from the battlefield."
