If this is the case, use the Toughness characteristic of the majority of the models in the unit when the enemy makes wound rolls against it.  If there is no majority, the Deathwatch player may choose which of the values is used.  Whilst the unit includes any Deathwatch Terminators, it has the TERMINATOR keyword;  whilst it includes any Deathwatch Bikers, it has the BIKER keyword; whilst it includes any Deathwatch Vanguard Veterans, it has the JUMP PACK keyword."
