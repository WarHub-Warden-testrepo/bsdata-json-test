        "Instead of moving in their Movement phase, any THOUSAND SONS CHARACTER can, at the end of their Movement phase, attempt to summon a TZEENTCH DAEMON unit with this ability by performing a Daemonic Ritual (the character cannot do so if they arrived as reinforcements this turn).",

        "Roll up to 3 dice - this is your summoning roll. You can summon to the battlefield one new TZEENTCH DAEMONS unit that has the Daemonic Ritual ability and a Power Rating equal to or less than the total result. This unit is treated as reinforcements for your army and can be placed anywhere on the battlefield that is wholly within 12\" of the character and is more than 9\" from any enemy model. If the total rolled is insufficient to summon any unit, the ritual fails and no new unit is summoned.",
