Alternatively, you may randomly determine the power by rolling a D6 and consulting the table below; if you do so, you may attempt a second randomly determined power immediately after resolving the first power. Each time this model attempts to use one of its powers, roll a D6 to see if it is successful. If the result is equal to or greater than the Vortex Power characteristic shown in its damage table resolve the power's effects, otherwise the attempt to use the power fails and nothing happens."
