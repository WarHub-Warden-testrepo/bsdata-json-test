The same Boon cannot be received by a model more than once - if this happens, choose a result the model has not yet received (excluding Spawndom and Daemonhood). In the unlikely event of a character accruing all of the available boons besides Spawndom and Daemonhood, roll a single D6 instead; on a roll of 1-3, they receive the Spawndom result; on a roll of 4-6, they receive the Daemonhood result.  Chaos Spawn and  Daemon Princes of Tzeentch created by this effect must have the TZEENTCH keyword and do not cost any reinforcement points in a matched play game."
