In addition, if this unit consists of 1-3 models when it manifests Smite, it only does a single mortal wound.  If it consists of 4-6 models when it manifests Smite, it deals D3 mortal wounds. If the result of the psychic test was more than 10, the target suffers D6 mortal wounds instead. If it consists of 7-10 models when it manifests Smite, it always deals D6 mortal wounds."
