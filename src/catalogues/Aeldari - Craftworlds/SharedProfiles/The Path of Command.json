In addition, if your army is Battle-forged and this model is your Warlord and on the battlefield, roll a D6 for each Command Point spent when using Stratagems; on a 6 that Command Point is immediately refunded. Note that for Prince Yriel, the first effect of this ability applies specifically to IYANDEN units."
