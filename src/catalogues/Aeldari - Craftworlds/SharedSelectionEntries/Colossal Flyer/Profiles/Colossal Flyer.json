In addition, unless the attacking model has the FLY keyword, add 12\" to the measured distance to determine the range when making shooting attacks against this model. Note that this means many short-ranged shooting weapons will not be able to hit this model. Also, this model does not suffer the penalty for moving and firing Heavy weapons.’"
