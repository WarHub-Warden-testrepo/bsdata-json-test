To do so after he had been set up using the Cry of the Wind ability, pick an enemy unit within 12\" of him. To do so after he has moved, pick one enemy unit that he flew over. Then, in either case, roll one dice for each model in the enemy unit (up to a maximum of 3 dice). Each time you roll a 4+, the target unit suffers 1 mortal wound."
