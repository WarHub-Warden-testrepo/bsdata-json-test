When operating with Retracted Wings and this model Advances, add 24\" to its Move characteristic for that Movement phase instead of rolling a dice - it also gains a 5+ invulnerable save until it switches to operating with Extended Wings. While operating with Extended Wings, this model may be turned to face directly towards any one enemy model it has line of sight to instead of performing its first pivot in the Movement phase (as per the Wings of Khaine ability), this model then adds 1 when making hit rolls against the chosen enemy model for the following shooting phase, but also loses the Hard to Hit ability until it switches to operating with Retracted Wings."
