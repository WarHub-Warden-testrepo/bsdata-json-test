          "value": "At the start of any of your turns, before the beginning of the Movement phase, this vehicle may activate the Sky Hunter ability. When activated, this unit gains the Airborne and Lumbering Flyer abilities and uses the Movement characteristic for Sky Hunter instead of its regular Movement (see Damage table). The effects of this ability last until you choose to end them, which may be done at the beginning of any of your own Movement phases, at which point the vehicle loses the Airborne and Lumbering Flyer abilities until Sky Hunter is activated again."
