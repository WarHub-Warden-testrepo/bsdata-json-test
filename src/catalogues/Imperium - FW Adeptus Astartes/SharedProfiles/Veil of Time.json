Until the start of your next Psychic phase, you can re-roll charge rolls and Advance rolls for that unit and they always fight first in the Fight phase, even if they didnâ€™t charge. If the enemy also has units that have charged, or that have a similar ability, then alternate choosing units to fight with, starting with the player whose turn is taking place."
