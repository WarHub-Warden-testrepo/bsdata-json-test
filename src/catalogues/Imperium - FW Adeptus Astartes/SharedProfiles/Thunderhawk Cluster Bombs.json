After the Thunderhawk Gunship has moved, pick an enemy unit that it flew over. Roll 3D6 for every VEHICLE or MONSTER, or a D6 for every other model, up to a maximum of 12D6. For each roll of a 5+, the unit suffers a mortal wound. Units consisting of only CHARACTERS may not be targeted by this ability."
