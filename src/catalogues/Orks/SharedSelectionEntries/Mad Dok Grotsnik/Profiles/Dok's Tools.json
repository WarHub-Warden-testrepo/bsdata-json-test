This is not cumulative with other Dok's Tools or Biker Dok's Tools. In addition, at the end of your Movement phase, mad Dok Grotsnik can attempt to heal a single ORK INFANTRY or ORK BIKER model within 1\". Roll a D6; on a 1, the model you were attempting to heal loses a wound, but on any other result that model regains D3 wounds lost earlier in the battle.  You can only make one attempt to heal a given model with the Dok's Tools or Biker Dok's Tools ability in each turn."
