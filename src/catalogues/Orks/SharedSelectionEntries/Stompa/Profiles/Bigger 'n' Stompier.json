When a Stompa Falls Back, it can move over enemy INFANTRY models, though at the end of its move it must be more than 1\" from any enemy models.  A Stompa doesn't suffer the penalty for moving and firing Heavy weapons.  This model only gains a bonus to its saving throws for being in cover if at least half of the model is obscured from the firer."
