After the Burna-bommer has moved, pick one enemy unit that it flew over and roll a D6 for each model in the unit (up to a max of 10).   Add 1 to the dice rolls if the enemy unit is INFANTRY.  For each roll of a 5+, the unit being bombed suffers a mortal wound.  Each burna bomb can only be used once per battle."
