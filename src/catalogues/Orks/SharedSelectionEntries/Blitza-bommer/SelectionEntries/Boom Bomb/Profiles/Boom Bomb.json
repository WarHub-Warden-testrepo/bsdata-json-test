          "value": "A Blitza-bommer can drop one boom bomb as it flies over enemy units in its Movement phase.  After the Blitza-bommer has moved, pick one enemy unit that it flew over and roll a D6 for each model in the unit (up to a max of 10).  Roll 3 dice instead for each VEHICLE or MONSTER in the unit.  For each roll of a 4+, the unit being bombed suffers a mortal wound.  Each boom bomb can only be used once per battle."
