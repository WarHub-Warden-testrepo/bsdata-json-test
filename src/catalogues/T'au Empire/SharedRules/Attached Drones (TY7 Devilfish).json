        "When a Devilfish is set up, its accompanying Gun Drones are attached, and are treated as being embarked, though they do not count towards the total number of models embarked on the Devilfish. Whilst the Gun Drones remain attached, the Devilfish is considered to be equipped with the Drones' weapons in addition to its own.",

        "Both Drones can detach at the start of any of your Movement phases by disembarking. From that point onwards, the Drones are treated as a separate unit. They cannot reattach during the battle."
