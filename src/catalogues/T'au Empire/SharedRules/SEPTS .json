If a T'AU EMPIRE datasheet does not specify which sept it is drawn from, it will have the <SEPT> keyword. When you include such a unit in your army, you must nominate which sept that unit is from (or nominate that unit to be from the Farsight Enclaves). You then simply replace the <SEPT> keyword on that unit's datasheet with the name of your chosen sept, or the words 'Farsight Enclaves'. You can use any of the septs that you have read about, or make up your own.",
