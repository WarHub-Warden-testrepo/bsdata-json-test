      "description": "When you set up a Tidewall Droneport, you can also set up a unit of up to 4 Tactical Drones in the slots in the Droneport. These Drones begin the battle fully automated - they automatically shoot in each of your Shooting phases. If there is a friendly T'AU EMPIRE INFANTRY unit embarked on the Droneport at the beginning of your Movement phase, you can take control of the Drones, which then detach from the Droneport and act as a separate unit that is part of your army. In addition, while a friendly T'AU EMPIRE INFANTRY unit is embarked on the Droneport, the Tactical Drones activated this way can use that unit's Ballistic Skill instead of their own when making shooting attacks. If the Droneport is destroyed before the Drones are activated, they are destroyed as well.",
