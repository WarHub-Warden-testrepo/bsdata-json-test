        "Tactical Support Turrets are not set up when the unit is set up. Instead, once per game, at the end of any of your Movement phases, you may set up the Tactical Support Turret within coherency of its unit and more than 2\" away from any enemy models. The turret cannot move for any reason, and is destroyed if the unit moves out of unit coherency with it. ",
