        "If a model (other than a VEHICLE) fires a markerlight, it cannot fire any other weapons in that phase. When a unit is hit by a markerlight, place a counter next to it for the remainder of the phase. The table below describes the benefits T'AU EMPIRE models have when shooting at a unit that has markerlight counters. All benefits are cumulative.",

        "* 2 - Destroyer and seeker missiles fired at this unit use the firing model's Ballistic Skill (and any modifiers) rather than only hitting on a 6.",
        "* 3 - T'AU EMPIRE models attacking this unit do not suffer the penalty for moving and firing Heavy weapons or Advancing and firing Assault weapons.",
        "* 4 - The target unit does not gain any bonus to its saving throws for being in cover.",
        "* 5 or more - Add 1 to hit rolls for T'AU EMPIRE models attacking this unit."
