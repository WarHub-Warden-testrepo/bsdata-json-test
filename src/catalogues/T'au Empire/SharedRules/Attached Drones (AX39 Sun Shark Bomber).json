        "When a Sun Shark Bomber is set up, its accompanying Interceptor Drones are attached, and are treated as being embarked. Whilst the Interceptor Drones remain attached, the Sun Shark Gunship is considered to be equipped with the Drones' weapons in addition to its own. However, a hit roll of 1 when firing the ion rifle on overcharge setting results in one of the Drones being slain rather than the Sun Shark Bomber.",

        "Both Drones can detach at the start of any of your Movement phases by disembarking. From that point onwards, the Drones are treated as a separate unit. They cannot reattach during the battle."
