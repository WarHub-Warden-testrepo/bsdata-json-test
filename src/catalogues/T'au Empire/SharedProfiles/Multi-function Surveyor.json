Only one protocol may be activated per phase and per unit of DX-4 Technical Drones. * Repair Protocol: Select one friendly unit with the BATTLESUIT keyword within 3\" of the Technical Drone unit and roll a D6. On a roll of 4+, one model in the unit regains D3 wounds. * Surveillance Protocol: Select one enemy unit within 12\" of the Technical Drone unit. That unit gains no benefits to its armour save from being in cover until the start of your next turn."
