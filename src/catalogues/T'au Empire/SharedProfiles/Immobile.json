If this unit is affected by an ability that would normally force a vehicle to move, or renders a vehicle immobile, it takes one mortal wound instead. Successful repair attempts by any friendly model may not grant it the ability to move. During Fight phase, enemy models automatically hit this model - do not roll any dice."
