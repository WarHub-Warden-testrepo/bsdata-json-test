Additionally, the target unit suffers only 1 mortal wound rather than D3 (whether or not the result of the Psychic test is more than 10) – unless the target is a DAEMON, in which case it suffers 3 mortal wounds instead of D3 – and all DAEMON units within 6\" of Brother-Captain Stern also suffer a mortal wound."
