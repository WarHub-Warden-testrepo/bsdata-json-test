      "description": "At the end of your Movement phase, the Apothecary can attempt to heal or revive a single model. Select a friendly Grey Knight Infantry unit within 3\" of the Apothecary. If that unit contains a wounded model, it immediately regains D3 lost wounds. If the chosen unit contains no wounded models but one or more of its models have been slain during the battle, roll a D6. On a 4+ a single slain model is returned to the unit with 1 wound remaining. If an Apothecary fails to revive a model in this manner he can do nothing else for the remainder of the turn (shoot, charge, fight, etc) as he recovers the gene-seed of the fallen warrior. A unit can only be the target of the Narthecium ability once in each turn.",
