When a Knight Titan Falls Back, it can even move over enemy INFANTRY models, though at the end of its move it must be more than 1\" from all enemy units. A Knight Titan can shoot if there are enemy models within 1\" of it, as long as all the enemy models have the INFANTRY keyword. In this case, it can shoot the enemy unit that is within 1\" of it or any other visible enemy unit that is within range and more than 1\" away from any friendly models. In addition, the Knight Titan can move and fire Heavy weapons without suffering the penalty to its hit rolls. Finally, the Knight Titan only gains a bonus to its save in cover if at least half of the model is obscured from the bearer."
