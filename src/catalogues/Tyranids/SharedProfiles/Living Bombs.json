Furthermore, this unit is discounted for the purposes of any victory conditions - their destruction never awards any victory points, they do not count towards the number of models controlling an objective, and they do not count when determining if a player has any models left on the battlefield. If you are playing a matched game, the creation of these units (eg. from a Sporocyst's Spore Node ability) is free, and the unit's points cost does not come out of your pool of reinforcement points."
