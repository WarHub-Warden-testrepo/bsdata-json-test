At the same time, you can set up a <HIVE FLEET> Troops unit in the Trygon's tunnel. At the end of any of your Movement phases, set up the Trygon anywhere on the battlefield that is  more than 9\" away from any enemy models. If there is another unit in the Trygon's tunnel, set it up at the same time wholly within 3\" of the Trygon and more than 9\" away from any enemy models. Any models that you cannot place in this way are destroyed."
