If you do so, the hive ship can launch the Tyrannocyte at the end of any of your Movement phases - set it up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9\" away from any enemy models. Any models that are inside the Tyrannocyte must immediately disembark in the same manner as a unit disembarking from a transport, except that they must be more than 9\" away from any enemy models. Any models that cannot be set up in this way are destroyed."
