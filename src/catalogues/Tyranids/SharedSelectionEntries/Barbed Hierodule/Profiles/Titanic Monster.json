          "value": "A Barbed Hierodule can Fall Back in the Movement phase and still shoot and/or charge during its turn. When a Barbed Hierodule Falls Back, it can even move over enemy INFANTRY models, though at the end of its move it must be more than 1\" away from all enemy units. A Barbed Hierodule can shoot even if there are enemy models within 1\" of it, as long as all enemy models have the INFANTRY keyword. In this case, it can shoot the enemy unit that is within 1\" of it or any other visible enemy unit that is within range and more than 1\" away from any friendly models. In addition, the Barbed Hierodule can move and fire heavy weapons without suffering the penalty to its hit rolls. Finally, the Barbed Hierodule only gains the benefit of cover if at least half of the model is obscured from the bearer."
