          "value": "Each time a spore node hits its target, roll a D6 to find out how much damage is inflicted on the unit; on a 1 the mine fails to inflict an harm, on a 2-5 they inflict D3 mortal wounds, and on a 6 they inflict D6 mortal wounds. Each time a spore node attack misses its target, add a new unit of 3 <Hive Fleet> Spore Mines or 1 <Hive Fleet> Mucolid Spore to your army and set it up on the battlefield so that it is wholly within 6\" of the target unit and more than 3\" from any enemy model (any models that cannot be placed are destroyed). These then follow the rule for Mucolid Spores or Spore Mines (pg 99) that are part of your army, but they cannot move or charge during the turn they were set up. This weapon cannot be used to fire Overwatch."
