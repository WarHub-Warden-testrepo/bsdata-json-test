If it does so add a new unit of 10 Termagants to your army and set it up on the battlefield so that it is wholly within 6\" of the Tervigon and more than 1\" from the enemy. All of these models are armed with fleshborers. Alternatively, you can replace up to 10 models lost earlier in the battle in an existing unit of Termagants from your army that is within 6\" of the Tervigon. Models placed in this way must be within 6\" of the Tervigon and more than 1\" from the enemy. You can only replace models armed with fleshborers. If you cannot place some of the models the excess is discarded."
