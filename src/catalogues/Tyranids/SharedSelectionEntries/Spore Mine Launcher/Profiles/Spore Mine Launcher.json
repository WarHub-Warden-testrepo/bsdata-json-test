          "value": "Each time a spore mine launcher hits the target, roll a D6 to find out how much damage is inflicted on the target; on a 1 the Spore Mine fails to inflict any harm, on a 2-5 it inflicts 1 mortal wound, and on a 6 it inflicts D3 mortal wounds. Each time a spore mine launcher misses its target, set up a single <HIVE FLEET> Spore Mine model anywhere within 6\" of the target unit and more than 3\" from any enemy model (if the Spore Mine cannot be placed it is destroyed). This then follows the rules for a Spore Mine (pg 99) that is part of your army, but it cannot move or charge during the turn it was set up. This weapon can target units that are not visible to the firer, but it cannot be used to fire Overwatch."
