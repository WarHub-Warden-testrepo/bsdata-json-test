You can then set up any Genestealers lurking, instead of placing them on the battlefield. If an enemy model is ever within 9\" of an infestation node, the node is destroyed and removed from the battlefield. Whilst there are any friendly infestation nodes on the battlefield, this unit can stop lurking: at the end of your Movement phase, set it up wholly within 6\" of a friendly infestation node. That infestation node is then removed from the battlefield. If this unit is still lurking when the last friendly infestation node is removed, the unit is destroyed."
