          "value": "A Harpy can drop Spore Mines as it flies over enemy units in the Movement phase. To do so, after the Harpy has moved, pick one enemy unit that it flew over and roll a D6 for each model in the unit, up to maximum of 3 dice. Each time you roll a 4+ a Spore Mine has hit the target and explodes. Roll a D6 to find out how much damage is inflicted; on a 1 the Spore Mine fails to inflict any harm, on a 2-5 it inflicts 1 mortal wound, and on a 6 it inflicts D3 mortal wounds. Each time a Spore Mine misses its target, set up a single <HIVE FLEET> Spore Mine anywhere within 6\" of the target unit and more than 3\" from any enemy model (if the Spore Mine cannot be placed it is destroyed). This then follows the rules for a Spore Mine (pg 99) that is part of your army, but it cannot move or charge during the turn it was set up."
