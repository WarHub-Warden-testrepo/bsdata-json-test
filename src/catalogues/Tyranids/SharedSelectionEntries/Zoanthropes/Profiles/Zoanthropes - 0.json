          "value": "A Zoanthrope unit of 4 or more models can instead attempt to manifest two psychic powers in each friendly Psychic phase, and attempt to deny one psychic power in each enemy Psychic phase. When manifesting or denying a psychic power with a Zoanthrope unit, first select a model in the unit - measure range, visibility, etc. from this model. If this unit suffers Perils of the Warp, it suffers D3 mortal wounds as described in the core rules, but units within 6\" will only suffer damage if the Perils of the Warp causes the last model in the Zoanthrope unit to be slain."
