At the end of any of your Movement phases, it can launch an ambush - when it does so, roll a dice and consult the table. If you wish, before rolling on the Cult Ambush table for a GENESTEALER CULTS CHARACTER, you can pick one friendly GENESTEALER CULTS INFANTRY unit that was also set up in ambush to arrive with them; make one roll on the Cult Ambush table and apply the same result to both units. However, each of these unit must be set up within 6\" of each other. If your army is Battle-forged, a unit can only make use of this ability if every unit is its Detachment has the GENESTEALER CULTS keyword.",
