However, you can only include one ASTRA MILITARUM Detachment (one in which every unit has the ASTRA MILITARUM keyword) in a Battleforged army for each GENESTEALER CULT Detachment (one in which every unit has the GENESTEALER CULTS keyword) in that army and every unit in the ASTRA MILITARUM Detachment that has the <REGIMENT> keyword must replace it in every instance on its datasheet with BROOD BROTHERS (you cannot include any ASTRA MILITARUM named characters in such Detachments). In such cases, simply ignore the ASTRA MILITARUM units when choosing your army's Faction.",
