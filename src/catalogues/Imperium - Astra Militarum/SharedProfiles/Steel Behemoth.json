It can also still fire its weapons if enemy units are within 1\" of it (but only it twin heavy bolter or twin heavy flamer can target units that are within 1\" of it -- its other guns must raget other units). In addition this model only gains a bonus to its save in cover if at least half of the model is obscured from the firer."
