When it does so, every unit (both friendly and enemy) within D6\" is automatically hit by this weapon using the profile stated above – roll separately for each unit. Once this model has detonated its Cyclops demolition charge, remove it from play. Any Cyclops Demolition Vehicle that is removed from play in this way does not award Victory points in scenarios that offer Victory points for slaying enemy units."
