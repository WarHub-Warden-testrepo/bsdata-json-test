In a friendly Shooting phase, if you wish to fire the Deathstrike missile, roll a D6 and add the battle round number.  If the result is 8 or more, you can fire the Deathstrike missile during this Shooting phase.  For example, in the third battle round, a roll of 5+ would be needed to fire the Deathstrike missile."
