You can add 1 to hit rolls made for VEHICLES with this doctrine when firing Overwatch if they are within 3\" of one or more other friendly MORDIAN VEHICLES. These modifers to hit rolls are an exception to the normal rules which do not allow modifers when making Overwatch shots â€“ in such cases a result of 7 is also a successful hit."
