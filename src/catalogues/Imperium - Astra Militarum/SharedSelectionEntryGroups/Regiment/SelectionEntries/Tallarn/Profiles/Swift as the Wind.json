When they do so, they do not suffer the usual penalties to hit rolls for Assault weapons. VEHICLES with this doctrine do not suffer the penalty to their hit rolls for moving and firing Heavy weapons. If a TITANIC VEHICLE with this doctrine Advances, it treats all Heavy weapons it is equipped with as Assault weapons until the end of the turn (e.g. a Heavy D6 weapon is treated as an Assault D6 weapon)."
