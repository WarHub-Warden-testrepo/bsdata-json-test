At the end of any of your Movement phases this model can perform a drop pod assault.  - set it up anywhere on the battlefield that is more that 9\" away from any enemy models. Any models embarked inside must immediately disembark, but they must be set up more than 9\" away from any enemy model. Any models that cannot be set up because there is not enough room are slain."
