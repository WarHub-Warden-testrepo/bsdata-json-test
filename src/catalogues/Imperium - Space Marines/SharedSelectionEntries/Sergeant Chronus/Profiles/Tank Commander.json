Whilst commanding the vehicle, use that vehicle's normal profile, weapons, abilities, keywords, and characteristics, with the exception of its Ballistic Skill - use Sergeant Chronus' Ballistic Skill of 2+ when firing with the vechicle instead. If Sergeant Chronus is commanding a vehicle at the start of your turn, he can restore one lost wounds it has suffered.  If Sergeant Chronus' vehicle has been reduced to 0 wounds, set him up within 3\" before removing the vehicle from the battlefield. He is treated as a passenger disembarking from a destroyed transport. Assuming he survives, Sergeant Chronus then uses the Infantry profile above and the keywords below. He is equipped with a bolt pistol, servo-arm, and frag and krak grenades."
