Select a friendly <CHAPTER> INFANTRY or BIKER unit within 3\" of the Apothecary. If that unit contains a wounded model, it immediately regains D3 lost wounds. If the chosen unit contains no wounded models but one or more of its models have been slain during the battle, roll a D6. On a 4+ a single slain model is returned to the unit with 1 wound remaining. If the Apothecary fails to revive a model he can do nothing else for the remainder of the turn (shoot, charge, fight, ect.) as he recovers gene-seed of the fallen warrior. A unit can only be the target of the Narthecium ability once in each turn."
