When this model Falls Back, it can move over enemy INFANTRY models, though at the end of its move it must be more than 1\" away from all enemy units. This model can fire its shooting weapons even if there are enemy models within 1\" unless those enemy models are TITANIC. In this case, it can shoot the enemy unit that is within 1\" of it or any other visible enemy unit that is within range and more than 1\" away from any friendly models. In addition, this model can move and fire Heavy weapons without any penalty to its hit rolls. Finally, this model only gains a bonus to its save in cover if at least half of the model is obscured from the firer."
